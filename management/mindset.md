# Mindset

In decision theory and general systems theory, a mindset is a set of assumptions, methods, or notions held by one or more people or groups of people. A mindset can also be seen as arising out of a person's world view or philosophy of life. In my understanding, mindset is people's perspective to the world. Over the years I have learnd and believed that the following mindsets would help me greatly should I restart my journey after colleage.

The mindsets would have helped me be more successful along my journey, as well as made me a better person over the time and save me from temptations and risks.

1. **Be grateful**

Be grateful about everything that I experienced. First of all, be grateful for God, for everything that I have is given by HIM. Be grateful about my life, my talent, the water, food, and everything that I am given. Be grateful about my parents and family, for their endless love, support, and patience. Be grateful about my teachers who shedded lights and provided me the directions when I was in wilderness. Be grateful for the people who do NOT favor me, because that helps remove pride from my heart. Be grateful about the challenges and difficult situations that I experienced, because these make me stronger. 

Express my gratitude. Do not hide my gratitude just in my heart. Pray for my gratitude and show people my gratitude.

2. **Love and help people**

Love and help people when possible. Think about a blind people carrying a lantern walking in the darkness.The lantern lights up the road for others and help others to avoid run into the blind person.

There needs a caution that not to over promise and exaust myself when helping others. This is especially true in work and service. Do a great job on my own job first and be the salt and light.

3. **Have a growth mindset**

*Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts. â€“W. Churchill*

These wise words by Churchill unfold what the growth mindset is all about: seeing opportunities instead of obstacles. That means seeing failure as a chance to develop your abilities further, instead of rolling into your cocoon and hiding from the world. Take positive risks out of the comfortable zone to learn, fail, and grow.
